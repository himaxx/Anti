# Spoofing Detector
# Face Detection and Classification

This project focuses on detecting and classifying faces in real-time video streams as real or spoofed (fake) using computer vision techniques. The primary objective is to develop a robust system capable of distinguishing between authentic and spoofed faces, enabling potential applications in security, authentication, and related domains.
